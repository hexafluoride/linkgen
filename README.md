# linkgen
A program that generates logos resembling the ChainLink logo.

## Usage
Install the Carbon Regular font, located at the repository root. Launch LinkGenGui.exe.

## Building
The solution should build without any problems under VS 2017 Community. If you're using Mono, try `nuget restore` and `xbuild` at the repo root.

This is prerelease software.
I do not own the rights to the Carbon font.
