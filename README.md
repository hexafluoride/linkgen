# linkgen
A program that generates logos resembling the ChainLink logo.
Download binaries [here](https://github.com/hexafluoride/linkgen/releases).

## Usage
![Interface](https://i.imgur.com/AWwv4Mq.png)
Install the Carbon Regular font, located at the repository root. Launch LinkGenGui.exe.

Everything should be straightforward enough. I'll eventually write more detailed instructions here.

## Building
The solution should build without any problems under VS 2017 Community. If you're using Mono, try `nuget restore` and `xbuild` at the repo root.

This is prerelease software.
I do not own the rights to the Carbon font.
